# Privacy & Security Checklist

Before pushing to public repositories or sharing this code, ensure you've completed this checklist:

## ✅ Data Sanitization

### Personal Information Removed
- [ ] Names (Satheesh, Sowmiya, Vidhuna, Aadhya) → Generic names (John Doe, Jane Doe, Child One, Child Two)
- [ ] Specific salary amounts → Rounded/generic amounts
- [ ] Real asset values → Sample values
- [ ] Personal email addresses → demo@example.com
- [ ] Phone numbers → Removed or placeholder
- [ ] Specific dates of birth → Generic dates
- [ ] Real policy numbers → Generic policy numbers

### Files Checked
- [ ] `src/data/initialData.ts` - All personal data replaced
- [ ] `src/utils/demoData.ts` - All personal data replaced  
- [ ] `README.md` - Personal references removed
- [ ] Component files - No hardcoded personal data
- [ ] Configuration files - No sensitive data

## 🔒 Security Measures

### Environment Variables
- [ ] API keys moved to `.env` files
- [ ] `.env` files added to `.gitignore`
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in code
- [ ] Sample `.env.example` file created

### Git Security
- [ ] `.gitignore` updated with sensitive file patterns
- [ ] Git history checked for sensitive commits
- [ ] Consider using `git filter-branch` if sensitive data was committed

### Code Security
- [ ] No authentication credentials in code
- [ ] No database connection strings hardcoded
- [ ] No production URLs or endpoints exposed
- [ ] Input validation implemented

## 📝 Documentation

### README Updates
- [ ] Personal references removed from title and description
- [ ] Sample data clearly marked as demo/fictional
- [ ] Privacy section added
- [ ] Installation instructions generic
- [ ] No personal financial details in examples

### Code Comments
- [ ] No personal information in comments
- [ ] No TODO items with personal context
- [ ] Generic variable names used

## 🧪 Testing

### Data Validation
- [ ] Run `node scripts/sanitize-data.js` to scan for personal data
- [ ] Test application with sanitized data
- [ ] Verify all features work with generic data
- [ ] Check that no personal data appears in browser dev tools

### Build Testing
- [ ] Clean build successful (`npm run build`)
- [ ] No personal data in build output
- [ ] Production build tested (`npm run preview`)

## 🚀 Deployment Preparation

### Production Readiness
- [ ] Authentication system implemented
- [ ] Data encryption for sensitive information
- [ ] Secure session management
- [ ] HTTPS enforced
- [ ] Security headers configured

### Monitoring
- [ ] Error logging configured (without sensitive data)
- [ ] Performance monitoring setup
- [ ] Security monitoring in place
- [ ] Regular security updates planned

## 📋 Final Verification

Before making the repository public:

1. **Run the sanitization script**: `node scripts/sanitize-data.js`
2. **Manual review**: Search for any remaining personal references
3. **Test thoroughly**: Ensure all functionality works with sanitized data
4. **Security audit**: Review all code for potential security issues
5. **Documentation review**: Ensure all docs are generic and helpful

## 🆘 Emergency Response

If personal data is accidentally exposed:

1. **Immediate action**: Remove the sensitive data
2. **Git cleanup**: Use `git filter-branch` to remove from history
3. **Force push**: Update remote repository
4. **Rotate secrets**: Change any exposed API keys or passwords
5. **Monitor**: Watch for any unauthorized access

**Remember**: It's always better to be overly cautious with personal financial data. When in doubt, use generic placeholder data instead.
